/*
Loops allow your programs to execute lines of code repeatedly, saving you from needing to copy and paste or otherwise repeat lines of code
C provides a few different ways to implement loops in your programs, some of which likely look familiar from Scratch

while (true)
{

}
This is what we call an infinite loop
The lines of code between the curly braces will execute repeatedly from top-to-bottom, until and unless we break out of it(as with a break; statement)
or otherwise kill our program

while (boolean-expression)
{

}
If the boolean-expr evaluates to true, all lines of code between the curly braces will execute repeatedly, in order from top-to-bottom, until boolean-expr evaluates to false
Somewhat confusingly, the behavior of the Scratch block is reversed, but it's the closest analog

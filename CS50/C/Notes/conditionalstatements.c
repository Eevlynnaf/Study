/*
Conditional expresions allow you programs to make decisions and take different forks in the road,
depending on the values of variables or user input

C provides a few different ways to implement conditional expressions (also known as branches)
in your programs, some of which likely look familiar from Scratch

if (boolean-expression)
{

}

If the boolean-expression evaluates to true, all lines of code between the curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom
If the boolean-expression evaluates to false, those lines of code will not execute

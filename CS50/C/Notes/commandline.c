/*
The CS50 IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a cloud-based machine running Ubuntu, one of the many flavors of the Linux OS
Many modern Linux distributions have graphical user interfaces (GUI) to allow easy mouse-based navigation
Still, as a programmer you'll likely be using your terminal window frequently, and you can do many of the same tasks with keyboard commands

Let's have a look at some of the most important of these keyboard-based commands for working within the IDE of any UNIX-based system

ls
    Short for list, this command will give you a readout of all the files and folders in your current directory
cd <directory>
    Short for change directory, this command change your current directory to <directory>, which you specify, in your workspace or on your operating system
    The shorthand name for the current directory is .
    The shorthand name for the parent directory of the current directory is ..
    If ever curious about the name of the current directory, though the terminal prompt will often tell you, you can type pwd (present working directory)

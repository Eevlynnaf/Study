Arithmetic operators

In C we can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide numbers (/), as expected

int x = y + 1;
x = x * 5;

We also have the modulus operator, (%) which gives us the remainder when the number on the left of the operator is divided by the number on
the right

int m = 13 % 4;     //m is now 1

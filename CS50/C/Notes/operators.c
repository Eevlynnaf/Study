Arithmetic operators

In C we can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide numbers (/), as expected

int x = y + 1;
x = x * 5;

We also have the modulus operator, (%) which gives us the remainder when the number on the left of the operator is divided by the number on
the right

int m = 13 % 4;     //m is now 1

C also provides a shorthand way to apply an arithmetic operator to a single variable

x = x * 5;
x *= 5;

This trick works with all five basic arithmetic operators. C provides a further shorthand for incrementing or decrementing a variable by 1:

x++;
x--;

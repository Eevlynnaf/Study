/*
Boolean expressions are used in C for comparing values
All boolean expressions in C evaluate to one of two possible values - true or false

We can see the result of evaluating a Boolean expression in other programming constructs such as deciding which branch in a conditional to take,
or determining wether a loop should continue to run.

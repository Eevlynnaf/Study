/*
Boolean expressions are used in C for comparing values
All boolean expressions in C evaluate to one of two possible values - true or false

We can see the result of evaluating a Boolean expression in other programming constructs such as deciding which branch in a conditional to take,
or determining wether a loop should continue to run.
Sometimes when working with Boolean expressions we will use variables of type bool, but we don't have to
In C, every nonzero value is equivalent to true, and zero is false

Two main types of Boolean expressions: logical operators and relational operators

Logical operators

Logical AND(&&) is true if and only if both operands are true, otherwise false
Logical OR(||) is true if and only if at least one operand is true, otherwise false
Logical NOT(!) inverts the value of its operand

Relational operators
These behave as you would expect them to, and appear syntactically similar to how you may recall them from elementary arithmetic
Less than (x < y)
Less than or equal (x <= y)
Greater than (x > y)
Greater than or equal to (x >= y)

/*
To bring a variable into existence, you need simply specify the data type of the variable and give it a name

int number;
char letter;

If you wish to create multiple variables of the same type, you specify the name once, and then list as many variables of that type as you want

int height, width;
float sqrt2, sqrt3, pi;

Using a variable
After a variable has been declared, it's no longer necessary to specify that variable's type

int number;         //declaration
number = 17;        //assignment
char letter;        //declaration
letter = 'H';       //assignment

If you are simultaneously declaring and setting the value of a variable (sometimes called initializing)
you can consolidate this to one step

int number = 17;        //initialization
chat letter = 'H';      //initialization

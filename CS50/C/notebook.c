/*
Datatypes
int
The int data type is used for variables that will store integers
integers always take up 4 bytes of memory (32bits). This means the range of values they can store is necessarily to 32 bits worth o information
integer range:
-2^31 -> 0 -> +2^31 -1
half for negative numbers and half for positive numbers

unsigned int
unsigned is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types(including int)
which effectively doubles the positive range of variables of that type
at the cost of disallowing any negative values
unsigned int range:
0 ->  2^32 -1

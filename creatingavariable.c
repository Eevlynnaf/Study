/*
To bring a variable into existence, you need simply specify the data type of the variable and give it a name

int number;
char letter;

If you wish to create multiple variables of the same type, you specify the name once, and then list as many variables of that type as you want

int height, width;
float sqrt2, sqrt3, pi;
